# AuditTrail
 AuditTrail is a project developed as part of a Database Management Systems course during the second semester of the user's second year. This project integrates MySQL as the database management system and Visual Basic as the front-end application to provide a comprehensive expense tracking solution.  The primary objective of AuditTrail is to assist Angelito Sanchez, a foreman on a construction site, in managing and monitoring financial transactions efficiently. Given the dynamic nature of construction work, where multiple expenses such as labor wages, material procurement, and operational costs are incurred daily, AuditTrail aims to streamline record-keeping and ensure accurate financial oversight.  Key features of AuditTrail include:  Expense Logging: Users can record expenses with details such as amount, category, date, and description. Database Integration: MySQL serves as the backbone, securely storing all financial records for easy retrieval and analysis. Report Generation: The system can generate summaries and detailed reports to help Angelito Sanchez track spending patterns. User-Friendly Interface: Built with Visual Basic, the application ensures ease of use for non-technical users while maintaining robust functionality. Data Security: Secure authentication and access control mechanisms protect financial data from unauthorized modifications. This project serves as a practical solution tailored to the needs of a construction site foreman, providing an organized and reliable system for managing project expenses effectively.
